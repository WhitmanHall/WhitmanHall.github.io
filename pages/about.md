Hello, I'm Whitman Hall.

Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer, educator, fabricator, and tinkerer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Riverside in March 2024. Building and creating have been a lifelong passion of mine. I am always eager to take on new projects and opportunities that allow me to develop my skills and explore innovative techniques in designing and constructing mechanisms. This website serves as a platform to showcase my expertise and highlight selected projects that demonstrate my experience and capabilities.
