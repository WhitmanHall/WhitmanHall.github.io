Hello, I am Whitman Hall  
I am a mechanical engineer, educator, fabricator and tinkerer from the San Francisco Bay Area. I received my Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Riverside in March 2024 but I have been building things my whole life. I am always looking for new projects and opportunities that can help me learn new skills and techniques for designing and building mechanisms. I created this website to showcase my skills and select projects that I have completed over the years.
