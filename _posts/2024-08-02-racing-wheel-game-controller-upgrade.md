I had the idea for this project when I became disappointed with the strength and force feedback quality provided by my Logitech Driving Force GT racing wheel gaming controller. The original motor and power MOSFETS were rated for 3 amps and the power supply was only providing 0.75 Amps. I upgraded the wheel with a more powerful motor with more holding torque, power MOSFETS with better heat dissipation and 8 Amp ratings and a 6 Amp power supply with over-current protection. With these upgrades the wheel's force feedback is more responsive, the wheel has more torque, and the power chips run cooler than the original configuration.
