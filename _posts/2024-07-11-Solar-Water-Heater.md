During my time at UC Riverside, I enrolled in a senior design class where we were challenged to solve a specific problem given to my team by the EPA. Our task was to develop a solution for heating water for desalination purposes, constrained to a form factor suitable for rooftop installation. As the design and fabrication lead, I single-handedly designed the project in SolidWorks and played a pivotal role in guiding my teammates through the prototype construction.

## Design Phase
