During my time at UC Riverside I took a senior design class in which we were tasked with solving a specific problem. My group was given the problem of needing to heat up water for desalination purposes within a form factor that would fit on the roof of a building. I was the design and fabrication lead for the project and I single-handedly designed the project in solidworks and helped my teammates build the prototype.

## Building Timeline
