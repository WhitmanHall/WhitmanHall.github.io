I designed a replacement lid for a Krups coffee grinder using CAD software. The design process involved meticulous attention to detail to ensure a perfect fit. After finalizing the design, I 3D printed the lid and incorporated a see-through window at the top using acrylic, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.
