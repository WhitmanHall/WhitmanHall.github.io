This retired robot was built by myself and my friend Wesley Eccles in 2009. We competed with this robot in the San Francisco
based robotics competiton Robogames in the 120lb category. The robot is slightly disasembled as the parts were used for
other projects but the frame lives on at my community college electronics lab.
