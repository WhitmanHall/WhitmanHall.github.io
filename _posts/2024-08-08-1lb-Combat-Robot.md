In the late summer of 2023, I designed and built a 1lb combat robot named Chivvy to compete in the Southern California Attack Robotics (SCAR) Competition at the Orange County Maker Fair. Chivvy secured a respectable 9th place out of 16 in its weight class. In May 2024, I entered Chivvy in the Highlander Combat Robotics competition at UC Riverside, where it triumphed with a 1st place finish, earning the title for most destruction.

### Building Process
